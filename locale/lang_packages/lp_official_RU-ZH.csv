For each method of payment, you can decide whether or not you want Revel to print a receipt for the customer.\n\nIn addition to these standard payment methods, Revel supports alternative payment options such as manual credit cards, non-integrated credit cards, checks, etc.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about these alternative payment methods, please let us know when we call you back to continue setup."
MsgOnboardingPaymentProcessorTooltip,"ЖProcessors and gateways are necessary to complete credit card transactions with Revel. When credit cards are swiped, the transaction data is sent to the selected gateway, which in turn encrypts and authorizes payments. Once the transaction is completed, a message is sent from the POS to the gateway and the funds are released to the processor. The processor then transfers funds from the client's consumer’s bank to the client's bank.\n\nTo process credit card transactions, Revel Systems offers several options both in terms of hardware and credit card processing. To view hardware options, please visit Revel's Hardware/Peripherals page."
MsgOnboardingSalesTaxTooltip,"ЖIn this section, we are going to set up taxes for your system. The tax rate you enter here will be a charge placed onto the order based on the items sold.

MsgOnboardingReturnsTooltip,"ЖThis will allow you to process a return for an item without having to pull up the original order.

MsgOnboardingAlwaysOnModeTooltip,"ЖAlways On Mode is part of what makes Revel truly outstanding in the world of iPad point of sale systems.\n\nTraditional point of sale systems run on a local network, which ensured network speed but meant the owner had to deal with bulky hardware and expensive maintenance. With the advent of cloud-based computing, owners can now manage and access reports and business information from anywhere.\n\nRevel’s POS utilizes Hybrid Network Architecture, which offers the best of both worlds: the convenience and accessibility of the cloud and the reliability of a local network. When WiFi is slow Revel’s iPad POS Always On Mode enables a business to continue processing credit card payments locally on the device - once connectivity returns, data simply re-syncs with the cloud."
MsgOnboardingEnableOfflineCreditCardPaymentsTooltip,"ЖWhen Enabled, if the iPad cannot reach the payment processor, it will accept and hold the transaction until the processor can be reached.  When disabled, if the iPad cannot reach the payment processor, credit card payments will be rejected."
